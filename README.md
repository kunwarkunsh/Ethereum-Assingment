The provided Solidity contract defines a simple token called "MyToken" with public variables to store the token's name ("KUNSH"), abbreviation ("KSH"), and total supply. It also includes a mapping to keep track of the balances of different addresses. The contract features two primary functions: `mint` and `burn`. The `mint` function increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address by a given value, effectively creating new tokens. Conversely, the `burn` function decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address by a given value, but only if the address has a sufficient balance to cover the burn amount, effectively destroying tokens. This contract serves as a basic implementation of a mintable and burnable token.
